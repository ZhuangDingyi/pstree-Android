'''
Please develop a Caesar Encryption Server, which receives plaintext from clients and
sends the corresponding ciphertext to clients.
Only the letters need to be encrypted, e.g. How are you? â†’ Krz duh brx?
The Server can serve at most 2 clients concurrently, more clients coming have to wait.
The server-side program must be concurrent multi-threaded.
Client input :q to end the service.
For simplicity, you can execute one server and multiple clients in one host.
'''

In current folder, type command in Linux shell:
$ gcc -o client client.c
$ gcc -o server server.c -lpthread

In one terminal:
$ ./server 

In several independent terminals:
$ ./client
